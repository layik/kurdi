# kurdi

There are some hopefully useful files/scripts/chunks etc. to share with Kurdi developers.

1. kurdi_words.txt: a list of Kurdish words (currently 1,668,692), unique and alphabetically ordered (thanks to @dolanskurd).
Note that in the bar chart below, each of (و) and (ی) counted as both vowel and consonant. 

2. unicode_list.txt: list of unicode values for Kurdish alphabet (Arabic script) standard accepted and published on http://unicode.ekrg.org/ku_unicodes.html

3. [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) translations, includes ku.po for Drupal. Most of the translations come from https://localize.drupal.org/translate/languages/ku (now almost dead

4. KRG health institutions data (lat/lng and names) throughout KRG (see health)

Now that we have some good unique and cleaned up word-iest. We can do some statistics on them (in R for now):

```{r}
w = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layik/kurdi/master/corpus/kurdi_words.txt")
length(unique(w)) == length(w)
length(w)
# sample of those including ئا
length(grep("ئا", w))
# read in list of Kurdi chars
ku_v = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/layik/kurdi/master/corpus/letters_lines.txt")
message("Kurdish alphabet: ",  length(ku_v), " letters.")

letters_used = sapply(ku_v, function(x){
  length(grep(x, w))
})

# change h to doucheshme
names(letters_used)[names(letters_used) == 'ه'] = "ھ"
letters_used = sort(letters_used, decreasing = TRUE)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=names(letters_used),y=letters_used), stat='identity') + 
  xlab('Alphabet') + ylab('Frequency') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + 
  scale_x_discrete(limits=names(letters_used))

letters_used['ە']
```
